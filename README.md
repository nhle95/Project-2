Project 2 (David Ma, Idean Beheshti, Travis Frocione, Nhan Le)

  Proposal: 

    Comparing GPU prices between top retailers: 

       - Best Buy

       - Microcenter
      
      Sources: 
      
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/gpu-prices-prediction
        
            gpu_specs_prices.csv

      Process: 

       1. Scrape and extract data from each companyâ€™s website and create two csv files.

       2. Read the csv files using Jupyter Notebook and transform it using Pandas. 

       3. Merge the csv files and load the data into a single relational database. (SQL)

       4. Determine the retailer that offers the best value for customers looking to purchase a new GPU.

    Extract: 
We used three sources of data for this project. First, we extracted data from Best Buy and Microcenter's websites by web scpraping using splinter. To accomplish this, we created a for loop that identifies keywords and extracts all of the GPU models and prices listed on these websites, which was then formatted into a           dictionary on Python. Lastly, we found a csv file containing a comprehensive list of GPUs and prices on Kaggle, which we read and formatted using Pandas.         
    
    Transform: explains what data clearing or transformation was required at a professional level
    
    Load: explains the final database, tables/collections, and why the topic was chosen at a professional level
