      Process: 

       1. Extract data from each company’s website and create three csv files.

       2. Read the csv files using Jupyter Notebook and clean it using Pandas. 

       3. Transform the data by adding columns that list each retailer’s price and website link.

       4. Merge the csv files and load the data into a single relational database. (SQL)

       5. Determine the retailer that offers the best value for customers looking to purchase a new GPU.
